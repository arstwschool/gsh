        <div class="wb1">
            <div class="text">
                When compared to the science study group, a high percentage of 74.2% of the science study group feels
                that the lunch portion is insufficient, while only 11.5% of the Social group feels the same. The social
                study group's proportion of dissatisfaction with the lunch portion in various aspects is significantly
                lower than that of the science study group.
                <br><br>
                This may be related to the composition of the class groups, such as the higher number of boys in the
                science study group resulting in larger appetites, whereas the opposite is true for the social study
                group. Adjusting portion sizes based on gender ratios rather than solely relying on headcount
                distribution may be a potential solution. (See Figure 1)

                From these two charts, it can be observed that students finish eggs mostly, followed by other
                categories, which include special foods such as ice cream cones and steamed buns. Meat products come
                next in line. This might be attributed to eggs being the most preferred choice on average among
                students, while meat products are generally favored by the majority. (See Figures 2 and 3)

                Among the top five favorite dishes of students, four items on the least favorite list are vegetable
                dishes, which explains why there is the highest leftover amount for vegetable dishes in Figure 4.
                Considering Figure 2, although the proportion of students who like vegetables is on par with the top two
                choices, there are still many who dislike vegetables. This difference might be related to gender, or
                perhaps students only enjoy specific types of vegetables.
                <br><br>
                While fish is categorized as meat, it ranks third on the least favorite list. This could be due to the
                presence of bones in fish, making students reluctant to eat it.Cabbage ranks fifth on the favorite list.
                In the future, increasing the frequency of cabbage dishes might be beneficial. (See Figure 4)
