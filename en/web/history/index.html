        <div class="tbg1">The Motivations of The Founders</div>
        <div class="text">
            The initiators of the project were SYUAN-YI SHIH and CHUN-YAN YANG, who were
            students at the Junior High Department of Hui-Wen High School then. They participated in the Youth Creative
            Camp organized by the library director CHI-HUA TSAI in December 2015. The camp encouraged students to
            "propose to the world." Inspired by this, SYUAN-YI SHIH and CHUN-YAN YANG envisioned that the leftover food
            from daily nutritious lunches could become a considerable amount of kitchen waste or serve as food for pigs.
            Feeling it was a pity, they believed it could be better utilized and thus conceived the "The Sacred Food for
            the Homeless Project" with the motto "Transforming Leftovers into Sacred Food."
            <br><br>
            SYUAN-YI's inspiration was closely linked to his childhood experiences helping with
            farming tasks at his grandfather's house. Watching vegetables grow, he understood that not every seed would
            thrive, leading him to deeply appreciate the saying, "Treasure every grain of rice and every mouthful of
            food."
            <br>
            <img src="/gsh2024/assets/img/08.jpg" alt="ÁôºËµ∑‰∫∫" class="t1">
        </div>
        <div class="tbg2">The Initial Challenges of the Sacred Food for the Homeless Project</div>
        <div class="text">
            However, in the early stages of the project, difficulties abounded. Firstly, the
            school had a contract with a pig farm, agreeing to sell kitchen waste to them for 16,000 NTD annually.
            However, with the implementation of‚ÄúThe Sacred Food for the Homeless Project‚Äù, the amount of kitchen waste
            reduced by approximately one-fourth. Consequently, the contract was renegotiated, and the amount was lowered
            to 12,000 NTD, resolving part of the issue.
            <br><br>
            Next, identifying students willing to take on the responsibility of collecting
            leftovers was not an easy task. The founders of the project figured out a way, giving all the volunteers
            certificates as the credits to apply to universities. However, the hygiene and safety of the leftovers was
            still a main concern, which made the school hesitate to approve them due to potential risks. After
            overcoming numerous obstacles, the "People's Peace Foundation" was finally secured during the summer
            vacation of 2016 to undertake this significant responsibility.
            <br><br>
            Finally, the school had to avoid unclear liability in case of risks that could
            jeopardize the school's interests and reputation. Director CHI-HUA TSAI first signed an agreement with the
            head of the People's Peace Foundation, ensuring that in the event of food poisoning or other hygiene issues,
            the foundation would take full responsibility, absolving Hui-Wen High School of any involvement. Once this
            aspect was settled on the school's end, the project could finally proceed to implementation.
            <br>

        <div class="tbg3">Information Related to The Cooperative Foundation</div>
        <div class="text">
            The establishment at first was aimed at helping the impoverished. The brand logo
            depicts one person supporting another, symbolizing mutual assistance. Applying Maslow's hierarchy of needs,
            the foundation initially focused on addressing their physiological needs. During times of extreme hunger and
            cold, even securing basic sustenance was challenging, leaving individuals with little energy to seek
            employment. <br><br>Therefore, volunteers would distribute meals at locations where homeless people
            gathered. In the early stages, there were few donations of ingredients, and the foundation bore the cost of
            the food. Later on, generous individuals began providing food, and Hui-Wen High School established contact
            with the People's Peace Foundation. This collaboration ensured that fluctuations in food prices wouldn't
            result in homeless individuals missing meals. Students at the school would collect the meals, and the
            foundation would then transport and store them in insulated containers with lids. The containers would be
            opened just before distributing the meals. Previously, concerns arose about potential quality deterioration
            due to temperature changes, especially during the summer.<br><br>However, over the seven years of
            operation, there have been no issues with the food's quality. The head of the Taichung Peace Station
            explained that their kitchen undergoes daily cleaning, and the Hui-Wen meal service team diligently monitors
            the quality of ingredients. This meticulous process provides reassurance to those receiving the meals. The
            quantity of leftover food collected varies each day but is generally sufficient to feed around fifty to
            sixty individuals, and when quantities allow, meals can even be taken to-go.

        <div class="tbg2">Media Coverage</div>
        <div class="text">
            After media coverage from outlets such as the United Daily News, China Times, and
            other print media, the two initiators were recognized with the Mandarin Daily's 2016 "Good Young" Award in
            the "Social Engagement" category. Subsequently, their story caught the attention of Public Television (PTS),
            and filming began in early 2017. The documentary aired nationwide in March, gaining significant traction on
            Facebook with over 10,000 likes, 700,000 views, and nearly 10,000 shares within two days. Even celebrity Shu
            Qi shared the video on her Facebook, praising, "Not wasting food, good job, students!" As of today, the
            video has accumulated 2.37 million views, making it the most impactful episode in the PTS series on food and
            agricultural education.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, Hui-Wen High School's‚ÄúThe Sacred Food for the Homeless Project‚Äùmade its
            debut in junior high school social studies textbooks in 2020. In 2021, another publishing house included it
            as supplementary material in their course content.

        <div class="tbg1">Team Leader of This Project</div>
        <div class="text">
            The team leader reminisces about the most significant challenge faced at the project's inception ‚Äì
            recruiting volunteers. At that time, the officers had recently become acquainted with each other, making
            them unfamiliar with others. Drafting recruitment forms consumed much time, dealing with incomplete
            information and overlooked details. The forms were repeatedly sent back for revisions by the director,
            leading to a moment of self-doubt. The team leader questioned whether they should have taken on such a
            crucial role.
            <br><br>
            However, upon reflection, being a second-year student, it was time to take responsibility. They committed to
            persisting in their role, especially since the school's social studies textbook cited Hui-Wen's Sacred Food
            Project as one of the reasons for joining meal collection initiatives. Looking ahead, the hope is to expand
            beyond Hui-Wen High School and a few primary schools, aiming for a larger-scale operation. The belief is
            that this initiative can provide sustenance to many people.
            <br><br>
            A message from the officers to their junior peers emphasizes the scheduling of shifts on both odd and even
            weeks. Even when officers are busy or unable to attend, spontaneous meal collection still occurs, documented
            through photos sent to the officers via mobile phones. This dedication is considered a heartwarming gesture,
            and gratitude is expressed to everyone for their collective effort.
            <br><br>
            Finally, the opportunity for Hui-Wen High School to actively participate in such a meaningful community
            service project is considered an honor. Experiencing the challenges faced by those living on the streets
            fosters empathy, contributing to a more compassionate perspective on the world. The wish is for there to
            always be kind-hearted individuals silently contributing to corners of the world, embracing the Earth with
            love.
        </div>
        <div class="tbg2">Most Memorable Experience</div>
        <div class="text">
            The head of the Taichung Peace Station recalls his most memorable experience, serving an individual case
            from Taichung University of Education. This person, once an assistant teacher, faced family upheavals that
            led to homelessness. At one point, he was so hungry that he slept at the post office. Generous individuals
            provided him with milk and bread, giving him the strength to reach the People's Peace Foundation seeking
            help. The station head was deeply moved, realizing that a single meal provided had invisibly assisted many
            people. In light of this, he expressed to the homeless that they need not hesitate to come to the Taichung
            Peace Station for a meal. All they have to do is leave their name, with no need to disclose any other
            information.
