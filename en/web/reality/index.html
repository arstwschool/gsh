        <div class="text">
            As an organization needs continuity for traditions and culture to endure, it was decided that the students
            who volunteered for‚ÄúThe Sacred Food for the Homeless Project‚Äù in their first year would serve as Sacred Food
            officers in their second year. In order to generate officers, it was mandatory for new first-year students
            to participate. In 2023, a significant challenge emerged. The admission scores for the school have been
            increasing, with the female-to-male ratio shifting from around 2.2 times in 2016 to an exchange in 2023.
            This resulted in many first-year classes achieving full consumption, leading some first-year mentors to
            perceive the initiative as impractical. <br><br>In reality, since 2022, we noticed a gradual decrease in the
            amount of surplus food for‚ÄúThe Sacred Food for the Homeless Project‚Äù. Additionally, during the COVID-19
            period, many suppliers providing school meals went out of business. In the post-pandemic era, with rising
            costs across the board, those who used to be more generous with the quantity of food they were willing to
            accept are now more precise in their calculations. The People's Peace Foundation, which collaborates with
            our school, also experienced a sharp decline in meal collections during this time.

        <div class="text">
            Therefore, in 2023, leveraging the newly introduced bonus system, we hope to attract students from other
            grades to join. The bonus system was proposed by the current officers after noticing a decline in enthusiasm
            as the project progressed. Without substantial benefits and adequate motivation, meal collections were not
            as active. Consequently, the team leader proposed this idea to the school director. The proposal suggests
            awarding bonuses to the top three contributors from the Junior and Senior High Departments each semester.
            The more collections, the higher the bonus. Currently, the bonuses are set at 1000 NTD for the first place,
            800 NTD for the second place, and 500 NTD for the third place. It is anticipated that these amounts will be
            increased in the future.

        <div class="tbg3">Formation and Promotion of Sacred Food Officers</div>
        <div class="text">
            As the first year approaches its end,‚ÄúThe Sacred Food for the Homeless Project‚Äùseeks volunteers for the next
            term's officers. Through interviews, individuals who demonstrate sincerity and responsibility are selected.
            Initially, the willingness to help collect surplus food among the first-year students was sporadic. Even
            with promotional efforts during freshmen orientation, the impact was limited. Later, by leveraging
            connections within the first-year cohort and emphasizing the principle of "friends united, strength
            assured," the participation rate increased. The current officers shared their personal journeys, alleviating
            concerns and demonstrating that meal collection wouldn't heavily burden their daily routines or infringe on
            lunch breaks. <br><br>This year, the participation rate in‚ÄúThe Sacred Food for the Homeless Project‚Äùis higher
            than previous years, involving a total of 19 classes, primarily from the first and second grades. To
            maintain a consistent surplus food supply, officers remind classes that haven't delivered their collections
            to the central area regularly. This proactive approach helps bridge the gap and prevents significant
            disparities in the quantity of leftover food each day, ensuring that the large bins are not left empty.<br>

        <div class="tbg1">Nutritious Lunch Cooking Process</div>
        <div class="text">
            The school's nutritious lunch program is a public-private partnership, with nutritionists playing a
            supervisory role. The first line of defense in ensuring food quality is the inspection of ingredients. This
            involves assessing the appearance, checking the texture and temperature by touch to ensure they are within
            normal ranges. Weight, expiration dates, and adherence to relevant certifications are also part of the
            inspection process.
            <br><br>
            Once the inspection is complete, the ingredients are handed over to the preprocessing staff. Since most of
            the ingredients are already pre-cut, only a small portion is handled by the lunch kitchen. This facilitates
            the use of a three-sink system for washing. Vegetables and meat undergo cleaning in separate sinks.
            Subsequently, the chef takes charge of cooking these ingredients, following the sequence from soup to side
            dishes to the main course. The final step involves blanching the vegetables.
        </div>
        <div class="tbg1">Hygiene-related Regulations and Inspection Process</div>
        <div class="text" style="margin-bottom: 0;">
            The cooking process adheres to the standards of good hygiene practices and operates under the Hazard
            Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) control system, which includes temperature control. Ingredients
            selected are sourced from Taiwan's excellent agricultural products, organic farms, and those with Traceable
            Agricultural Product (TAP) records, ensuring traceability in production. There is no preference for specific
            brands; adherence to contract-defined certifications and the mentioned standards is sufficient. To enhance
            hygiene, the kitchen is located in the basement. The procurement of better equipment, such as exhaust fans,
            aims to create a more optimal working environment for staff and provide a more reassuring dining experience.

        <div class="tbg2">Role of a Nutritionist</div>
        <div class="text">
            The nutritionist sees the greatest challenge in our school being a complete middle and high school, where
            high school students tend to be more discerning about changes in ingredients and flavors compared to their
            middle school counterparts. Creating a menu that ensures students perceive the school lunch as not only
            nutritious but also appetizing and healthy requires thoughtful consideration. The nutritionist plays a
            crucial role in ensuring the safety and hygiene of meals for the entire school community.
            <br><br>
            In addition to menu planning, the nutritionist is involved in nutritional education advocacy through
            materials like pamphlets, setting up booths during school celebrations for nutritional education, and
            conducting educational lectures each semester. The feedback from students in these activities is considered
            a meaningful accomplishment by the nutritionist.
            <br><br>
            Recognizing that students' nutritional knowledge can be influenced by television and peers, the nutritionist
            believes it is important to empower students to understand food safety and hygiene. By providing practical
            applications in daily life and encouraging students to make informed choices based on accurate knowledge,
            the nutritionist aims to foster a better understanding of nutrition.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, the nutritionist appreciates initiatives like the Sacred Food Project, where excess food is
            redistributed, aligning with the concept of a food bank. This approach encourages better utilization of
            surplus food, contributing to a more sustainable and compassionate environment.
            <br>

        <div class="tbg1">Students Feedback</div>
        <div class="text">
            The lunch kitchen gathers information from both the amount of kitchen waste collected and satisfaction
            surveys from each class. This allows us to understand which foods are more favored by students. Striving for
            a balance between nutritional balance and students' preferences, the goal is to effectively achieve portion
            control. However, on Wednesdays, designated as vegetarian days, many students opt for hot food items,
            resulting in more kitchen waste. The nutritionist acknowledges that this situation is challenging to avoid
            but is committed to adjusting the menu accordingly.
            <br><br>
            In addressing food waste, an alternative proposed solution is to allow students to decide on the menu for
            certain days. However, implementation is challenging, as the menu needs to be finalized two weeks in
            advance, and aligning the student-selected menu with the health standards set by the Ministry of Education
            poses difficulties. Nevertheless, for special occasions such as school celebrations and Christmas, three
            meal options are designed for each class to vote on, and the menu for the day is determined based on the
            vote percentages, ensuring student involvement and satisfaction.
