                        In this web competition, it was the largest project I've ever led in terms of data volume. As a
                        leader, I had to maintain a high vantage point to see what others couldn't see, while also being
                        attentive to every detail. The agility to switch between these two different roles and
                        persistent communication without giving up were my greatest learning experiences. Additionally,
                        this was my first time producing an interview-style video, which differed from my previous
                        experiences in making short films. It required more time to contemplate the message conveyed by
                        the interviewees and to edit it into a cohesive presentation for the audience. Throughout the
                        production process, there were many challenges, but I am grateful for the support of my team
                        members and the careful guidance of our supervisor, which allowed us to successfully complete
                        the project.

                        Participating in this international web competition was a significant challenge for me, testing
                        my ability to collaborate effectively. As the leader of the text team, I learned how to enhance
                        my skills in drafting written content and delegating tasks to team members. I also gained
                        valuable insights into crafting interview outlines before interviews and drafting transcripts
                        afterward, which proved to be immensely beneficial. Finally, I am grateful to our director,
                        teachers, and fellow members of the web competition for their collaborative efforts in
                        completing this project.

                    <div class="briefing">
                        I often find myself admiring unique design elements or attractive color schemes when browsing
                        various websites. I make it a point to inspect them closely using developer tools to understand
                        their intricacies. This habit has enabled me to develop my skills, and I collaborated well with
                        the main graphic designer for this project. Although occasionally the layout of my work may
                        differ from my initial expectations, I view these instances as stepping stones in my journey of
                        learning web design.
                        <br>
                        This web design project posed a considerable challenge for me. Unlike the previous year's web
                        competition, where I modified templates, this time I built the entire webpage from scratch,
                        including its functionality and layout. Additionally, I utilized this web competition as an
                        opportunity to modularize some of the JavaScript functions within my webpage, making them more
                        adaptable for future projects.

                    <div class="briefing">
                        Before participating in the web design competition, I had always been passionate about web
                        design and text layout. I often carefully observed various websites with sophisticated designs
                        to understand their intricacies and techniques.
                        <br>
                        The graphic design work this time was different from what I had learned in class, leaning more
                        towards practicality. I learned how to divide graphics into different sections for use by
                        programmers. Additionally, I learned how to clearly highlight the key points in the visuals.
                        These required me to adopt a different perspective and evaluate design styles and steps from the
                        viewer's standpoint.
                        <br>
                        Through participating in the web design competition, I realized the importance of communication
                        and coordination with others or future clients. I will apply the experiences gained from this to
                        future work, enabling me to collaborate more effectively with others and produce even better
                        results!

                        This web competition was perhaps the largest-scale competition I've ever participated in! The
                        importance of collaboration and division of labor became even more apparent. Compared to the
                        tasks of the text team, data analysis seemed almost trivial. During the analysis process, the
                        absence of Excel and AI would have left us feeling lost. Utilizing information tools effectively
                        may indeed be a survival skill required of us in this century! I am also grateful for the
                        cooperation of our team leader and members. Timely sharing of opinions allowed us to complete
                        the work as planned. Each person was an indispensable part during this period. Without any one
                        of us, the results achieved today would not have been possible!

                        This web competition has been the most profound experience of teamwork I've encountered in my
                        life so far. Tasks that could have been easily completed by one or a few individuals in school
                        turned out to be on a much larger scale this time, leading to a much finer division of labor
                        among us.
                        <br>
                        During the process of data analysis, I learned that ChatGPT is not a universal solution. Despite
                        providing it with the same data, it often generated a variety of strange and unexpected results.
                        This meant that I had to put in extra effort to sift through and interpret the data.
                        <br>
                        This competition also taught me the importance of addressing issues promptly when given the
                        opportunity, as delaying them might leave us with even less time to handle them later.
                        <br>
                        I want to express my gratitude to my teammates and our mentors for their assistance. It's thanks
